You are building a BRAND-NEW, production-ready website from scratch for a real UK trade client.

This is NOT a demo, NOT a mockup, and NOT a portfolio site.
It must be accurate, trustworthy, SEO-friendly, mobile-first, and conversion-focused for emergency plumbing and drainage work.

════════════════════════════════════
TECH STACK (CHOOSE ONE)
════════════════════════════════════
Preferred:
Option A — Plain HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript
- Multi-page structure (separate HTML files)
- Shared header/footer reused consistently
- No frameworks unless necessary

If you choose a framework, keep it extremely simple and explain setup clearly.

════════════════════════════════════
THEME & VISUAL DESIGN (APPLY SITE-WIDE)
════════════════════════════════════
Color palette (CSS variables):
- --primary: Professional Blue (trust, expertise)
- --accent: Emergency Red (ONLY for emergency banners and primary “Call Now” CTAs)
- Neutral background, text, border colours for clarity and contrast

Typography:
- Headings (H1–H3, hero text): Outfit
- Body text, nav, forms: DM Sans
- Consistent type scale across the site

Visual style:
- Modern “glass-card” aesthetic:
  - subtle backdrop blur
  - soft gradients
  - light borders and shadows
  - rounded corners
- Use glass cards for:
  - trust blocks
  - service cards
  - booking form container
  - key content sections

Design must feel:
- Professional
- Reassuring
- Emergency-ready
- Not overly corporate or tech-startup-like

════════════════════════════════════
HOMEPAGE HERO (VERY IMPORTANT)
════════════════════════════════════
The Home page hero must visually match this style:
- Clean, modern, high-conversion layout
- Two-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile

Left side:
- Small pill/badge: “Available 24/7 for Emergencies”
- Strong headline focused on problems solved (plumbing & drainage)
- Supporting text mentioning:
  - Essex
  - M25 radius
  - Cambridge
  - Luton
  - 30+ years combined experience
- Two CTAs:
  1) Call Now (Emergency Red)
  2) Book Online (secondary)
- Small trust row using ONLY real facts

Right side:
- Neutral, professional hero image or illustration
- NO fake people, NO fake claims, NO testimonials

════════════════════════════════════
NON-NEGOTIABLE CONVERSION UX
════════════════════════════════════
1) Sticky Mobile CTA Bar (ALL pages):
   - Primary: Call Now (tel:+44XXXXXXXXXX placeholder)
   - Secondary: Book Online
   - Must never cover content

2) Emergency Banner (ALL pages):
   - Text: “24/7 Emergency Call-Outs • 365 Days a Year”
   - Subtext: “Plumbing, Drainage & Tanker Services”
   - Use Emergency Red
   - Slight attention animation ONCE on load (optional, subtle)

3) “Call Now” must always be the most visually dominant action.
